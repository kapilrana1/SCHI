# Project Overview

This project is a web-based certificate search and download portal for students. It allows individual and bulk certificate downloads, with password protection for bulk downloads.

- Main files: `index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`
- Certificates are stored in the `certificates/` folder.
- Bulk download uses JSZip to create a ZIP file in the browser.
