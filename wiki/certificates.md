# Certificates Folder

All certificate files (JPG, PNG, PDF) are stored in the `certificates/` folder. For bulk download, the script fetches all files listed in the `allCertificates` array in `script.js`.

If you want to add or remove certificates, update the `allCertificates` array accordingly.
